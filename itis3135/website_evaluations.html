            <h3><a href="https://www.pkmn.gg" target="_blank">pkmn.gg</a></h3>
            <p>pkmn.gg is a Pokémon card database that boasts its excellent UI and ease-of-use, which also includes a feature to track your entire collection and its value.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> Pkmngg does follow this principle. The site uses a contrast of a dark grey background with a light grey rounded box used for important information, or an enlarged card with green text under it to show the price of the card.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition:</b> Pkmngg does follow this principle. The button layout is very consistent throughout every card description and menu page, and every card is displayed the same way with the exact same options.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> Pkmngg does follow this principle. The layout when you search a card or look at a card in your collection is done so using grid alignment, which ensures every page/row has an easy-to-follow lookup system.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity: </b> Pkmngg does follow this principle. All cards, when searched, follow a consistent size and margin spacing between one another in a natural way, ensuring ease-of-use for any users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.angelfire.com/super/badwebs/" target="_blank">World's Worst Website</a></h3>
            <p>World’s Worst Website is a website that practically tells you what it’s about from the title alone! It’s a horrible website!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> The World’s Worst Website does not follow this principle. The background color and text are the worst color choices ever! It even states “There needs to more contrast between the background color and the text color.” </li>
                 <li><b>Repetition:</b> The World’s Worst Website does not follow this principle. There are zero repeating factors in the site besides the looping obnoxious background, and everything feels completely random.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> The World’s Worst Website does not follow this principle. At the bare minimum, it seems that most of the text and text boxes are center-aligned; however, there are many pieces of text that are randomly left-aligned, right-aligned, even not aligned!</li>
                <li><b>Proximity: </b> The World’s Worst Website does not follow this principle. Everything is jumbled up together with minimal grouping which makes it very hard to tell if there are any specific sections at all.</li>
